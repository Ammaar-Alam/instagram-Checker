Tutorial assets
----------------

Drop annotated screenshots or short clips for the guided tutorial here.

Accepted naming
- Numeric only: 01.png, 02.png, … 07.png (preferred)
- Also supported: step1.png, step2.png, … step7.png

Notes
- Supported formats: .png, .jpg, .webp, .gif, .mp4 (short clips).
- Keep files small (<1–2 MB each) for fast loads.
- Avoid personal info: crop/redact usernames/emails where needed.
- Use arrows/highlights to indicate exactly where to click.

Integration
- The app already includes a step-by-step guide. If you’d like these visuals embedded, tell me and I’ll wire the Stepper to display the corresponding image/video per step.
